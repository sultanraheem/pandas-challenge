## pandas-challenge

NOTE: This assignment has been done through group work with myself, Robert Molenda, Lucas Perez, and Muneeb Samad.

## contents

The Jupyter Notebook file can be run through Jupyter Notebook or VSCode, I have used both on separate occasions throughout completing the assignment. 

The report is in PDF format and included within the PyCitySchools folder.

## Limitations mentioned in the written report

These have been forwarded from the written component for clarity.

One thing to note is that I have all calculations except the total students, the total students are present in Figure 7 district summary, but not the school summary. It is just a limitation of my submission. 

Additional: The scores by school size only output small schools, medium and large schools are not generated.
